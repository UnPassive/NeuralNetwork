# NeuralNetwork
Multi-layer feedforward and Radial basis function neural networks

So turns out it's bad practice to push .class files because they're specific to development platforms so don't push those.
Lets all agree to be careful with merges since we will be editing the same files at the same time. Feel free to utalize braches.
Here is a few not so good resources but basically all I could find for using gitbash's mergetool:

Between both there should be enough information to add new methods and update the code without trashing someone else's work.
If we communicate and delegate well then two people wont accidentally write the same method and have to trash one.
May the odds be ever in your favor.
